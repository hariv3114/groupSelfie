Group Selfie is an online AWS S3 backed image/file sharing single page application.

Angular for front end
Form.io backed resource-api management
NodeJS for server side runtime environment
gulp for distribution and task streams
Yeoman for scaffolding.

Originally designed and built by Travis Tidwell in an Angular JS meetup, I intend to extend it with some of my own extra's like OAuth and use it for my personal circle to share some grad pics.
