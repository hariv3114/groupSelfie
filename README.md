Group Selfie is an online AWS S3 backed image/file sharing single page application.

[Angular](https://angularjs.org/) for front end.

[Form.io](https://form.io/) backed resource-api management.

[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) for server side runtime environment.

[gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) for distribution and task streams.

Originally designed and built by [Travis Tidwell](https://github.com/travist) in an Angular JS [meetup](http://www.meetup.com/AngularJS-DFW-Area/events/229497311/), I intend to extend it with some of my own extra's like OAuth and use it for my personal circle to share some grad pics.
